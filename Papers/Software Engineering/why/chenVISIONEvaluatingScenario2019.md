## Abstract

Software systems assisted with deep neural networks (DNNs) are gaining increasing popularities. However, one outstanding problem is to judge **whether a given application scenario suits a DNN model, whose answer highly affects its concerned system’s performance**. Existing work indirectly addressed this problem by seeking for higher test coverage or generating adversarial inputs. One pioneering work is *SynEva, which exactly addressed this problem by synthesizing mirror programs for scenario suitableness evaluation of general machine learning programs, but fell short in supporting DNN models*. **In this paper, we propose VISION to eValuatIng Scenario suItableness fOr DNN models, specially catered for DNN characteristics.** We conducted experiments on a real-world self-driving dataset Udacity, and the results show that VISION was effective in evaluating scenario suitableness for DNN models with an accuracy of 75.6–89.0% as compared to that of SynEva, 50.0–81.8%. We also explored different meta-models in VISION, and found out that the decision tree logic learner meta-model could be the best one for balancing VISION’s effectiveness and efﬁciency.
