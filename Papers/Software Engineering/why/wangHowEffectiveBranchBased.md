## Abstract

Combinatorial testing detects faults by trying different value combinations for program inputs. Traditional combinatorial testing treats programs as black box and focuses on manipulating program inputs (named input-based combinatorial testing or ICT). **In this paper, we explore the possibility of conducting combinatorial testing via white-box branch information.** Similarly, different combinations of branches taken in an execution are tried to test whether they help detect faults and to what extent. We name this technique branch-based combinatorial testing (BCT). We propose ways to address challenges in realizing BCT, and evaluate BCT with Java programs. The results reported that BCT can effectively detect faults even with lowlevel combinations, say 3-4 ways, which suggest it to be a strong test adequacy criterion. We also found that our greedy strategy for minimizing test suites reduces over 50% tests for reaching certain way levels, and merging nested branches detects faults more cost-effectively than considering them separately.
