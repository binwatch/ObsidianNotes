## Abstract

Spreadsheets are widely used but subject to various defects. In this paper, we present SGUARD to effectively detect spreadsheet defects. SGUARD learns spreadsheet features to cluster cells with similar computational semantics, and then reÔ¨Åne these clusters to recognize anomalous cells as defects. SGUARD well balances the trade-off between the precision (87.8%) and recall rate (71.9%) in the defect detection, and achieves an F-measure of 0.79, exceeding existing spreadsheet defect detection techniques. We introduce the SGUARD implementation and its usage by a video presentation (https://youtu.be/gNPmMvQVf5Q), and provide its public download repository (https://github.com/sheetguard/sguard).
