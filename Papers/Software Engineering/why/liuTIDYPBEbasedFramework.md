## Abstract

Objective: This article presents TIDY, a PBE-based framework, to assist automated entity transformations for their layout and style consistency in rich-formatted documents like PowerPoint, in a way adaptive to entity contexts and flexible with user selections.
Methods: TIDY achieves this by examining entitiesâ€™ operation histories, and proposes a two-stage framework to first identify user intentions behind histories and then make wise next-operation recommendations for users, in order to maintain the entity consistency for rich-formatted documents.
Results: We implemented TIDY as a prototype tool and integrated it into PowerPoint as a plug-in module. We experimentally evaluated TIDY with real-world user operation data. The evaluation reports that TIDY achieved promising effectiveness with a hit rate of 77.3% on average, which was stably holding for a variety of editing tasks. Besides, TIDY took only marginal time overhead, costing several to several tens of milliseconds, to complete each recommendation.
Conclusion: TIDY assists users to complete repetitive tasks in rich-formatted documents by non-intrusive user intention recognition and smart next-operation recommendations, which is effective and practically useful.
