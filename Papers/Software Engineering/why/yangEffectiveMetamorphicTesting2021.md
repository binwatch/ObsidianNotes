## Abstract

The quality assurance for machine learning systems is becoming increasingly critical nowadays. While many eﬀorts have been paid on trained models from such systems, we focus on the quality of these systems themselves, as the latter essentially decides the quality of numerous models thus trained. **In this article, we focus particularly on detecting bugs in implementing one class of model-training systems, namely, linear classiﬁcation algorithms, which are known to be challenging due to the lack of test oracle.** Existing work has attempted to use metamorphic testing to alleviate the oracle problem, but fallen short on overlooking the statistical nature of such learning algorithms, leading to premature metamorphic relations (MRs) suﬀering eﬃcacy and necessity issues. To address this problem, we ﬁrst derive MRs from a fundamental property of linear classiﬁcation algorithms, i.e., algorithm stability, with the soundness guarantee. We then formulate such MRs in a way that is rare in usage but could be more eﬀective according to our ﬁeld study and analysis, i.e., Past-execution Dependent MR (PDMR), as contrast to the traditional way, i.e., Past-execution Independent MR (PI-MR), which has been extensively studied. We experimentally evaluated our new MRs upon nine well-known linear classiﬁcation algorithms. The results reported that the new MRs detected 37.6-329.2% more bugs than existing benchmark MRs.
